= Kotlin Web Frameworks Hello World =

This project shows how to do a web-based "Hello World!" with Kotlin in combination with various JVM-based
web frameworks.

Pull requests for new frameworks are welcome.

== Hello World Benchmarking

While a `Hello World!` is not a realistic production operation, it can be useful to benchmark it to get a
basic idea of how well the framework operates, without complicating matters with other work. The results of
this will essentially be a best case throughput and latency scenario for the benchmarked system.

Example load test with `wrk`:

```
wrk -t6 -c200 -d30s --latency --timeout 2s http://localhost:8080/
```

will produce output like:

```
Running 30s test @ http://localhost:8080/
  6 threads and 200 connections
  Thread Stats   Avg      Stdev     Max   +/- Stdev
